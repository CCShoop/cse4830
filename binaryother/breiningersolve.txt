I opened the binary in Binary Ninja and found the ptrace condition that swapped which string the input was compared to.
Upon looking into the called function, I found that it beginning with "h" would end the program, so the input
had to be put in while the binary was running with ptrace active. Running the binary in gdb allowed me to,
while considering the letter/number conversions, confirm that "p3anut br1ttl3" was the correct input. As for the pin,
I reversed the calculations done and determined that it was 7.
