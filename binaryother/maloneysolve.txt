After looking through Binary Ninja, I knew that I needed to have a numerical input that would be modified
by several functions before it was compared to a set number. By reversing the order of the functions and manually
shifting them to the right, manually reversing the numbers, and utilizing GDB to see how it would change certain inputs to solve xor1(), I was able to determine the input that would release the flag.
