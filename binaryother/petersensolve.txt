Upon opening Binary Ninja I immediately saw 3 multiply() functions that took variables as input. These variables
were entered (with the first and second inputs flipped in order) by the user and then modified by the multiply()
function prior to going into the pass() function. Looking into the multiply function, I realized that it did not
modify the input value at all before returning it. I followed the inputs (in order) to the pass() function,
and went through each of the rax values to determine what they were returned as, finding 2548, 162, and 128.
I looked at the if/else statements and noticed that rax_2 and rax_1 are flipped while the input args are in order,
so I flipped the second and third input and got the flag with "2548 128 162."
